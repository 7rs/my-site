# Introduction  

  I'm **Cbrnex**. You can read "Seaburn Cross" or "Seaburn X."
  **Cbrnex** come from [an acronym CBRNE][cbrne].  
  Sometimes I use **7rs**. Because I wanna keep userid short.  

  My friends call me **"Manji"**, but I don't use it as a display name.
  Because **"Manji"** means bad symbol.  
  However, It isn't used as a bad symbol in Japan, but as a map symbol for temples.
  Japanese call nazi*m symbol "Harkenkreuz".  

  Cbrne is a generic term for weapons and disasters, so probably "Cbrnex" doesn't have problems...

## I'm a programmer  

  I don't like front-end very much. ~~Because it consuming my time.~~
  Even so, I don't have extensive back-end or server-side experience...  
  I have used **Python**, **Golang**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **Lua**, **ShellScript (bash, zsh)**, etc.
  I wanna learn **Rust**, **Swift**, **Haskell**. ~~I just wanna learn.~~
