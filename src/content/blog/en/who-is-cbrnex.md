## What your name?  

  I always use a name **Cbrnex**. It come from [CBRNE][cbrne] that is an acronym for:  

- Chemical  
- Biological  
- Radiological  
- Nuclear  
- Explosive  

  > [CBRNE - Wikipedia][cbrne]  

  I wanna be my userid to short, so I use userid "7rs".
  I'm always called "manji" by everyone, but I didn't use it as my display name.
  (Swaxtika and [Hxrknkreuz][h-kenkreuz] aren't distinction by everyone exceprt for Japanese people.)

  Probably I think A name "Cbrnex" hasn't probrems. Because it's a just general term for weapons and disasters.

  I have never post to [TASVideos][tasvideos] but I'm uploaded [YouTube][youtube].

  Lately, I wanna do brute-forcing[^brute-forcing] automatically.
  I think I have to use [Wafel][wafel] and [Bruteforcers][sm64_bruteforcers], etc.
  but I failed to build [libsm64][libsm64] in my environment.
  I don't have knowledges about C lang and buildings. I have no motivation doing it.

  However, [Lua script][lua] isn't easy either.
  Writing scripts isn't hard for me but I must develop frontend without frameworks.

[^brute-forcing]: Brute-forcings are brute-forcing for stick direction, etc.
