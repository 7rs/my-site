# Main Template  

  Templates are needed to unify UI.

## Components  

### [Header](/docs/rd/header.md)  

  Menu bar are needed to make page contents more readable.  
  If place it at the bottom, it covers the footer, so gotta place it at the top.  

### [Footer](/docs/rd/footer.md)  

  Footer is needed to display informations, credits, navigations, etc.  
  It's placed at the bottom because it isn't so important.  

### [Sidebar (Wide screen only)](/docs/rd/sidebar.md)  

  For example, in blogs on a PC screen, margins is created to limit the width of the content.  
  Places the sidebar in that margin.  
  Displays active table of contents, page informations, etc. in the sidebar.
